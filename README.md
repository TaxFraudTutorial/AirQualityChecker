# airQualityChecker
Air quality checker application written in python with the help of geocoder, time and requests.

2. Input coordinates or select "my location"
3. Get Air Quality information and if it's good or bad.

Make sure to edit the code and add your own API key from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and place it in the api key variable at the top.
